    <h2>What is Camera?</h2>
    <p>A camera is an optical instrument used to record images. At their most basic, cameras are sealed boxes (<em>the camera body</em>) with a small hole (<em>the aperture</em>) that let light in to capture an image on a light-sensitive surface (<em>usually photographic film or a digital sensor</em>). Cameras have various mechanisms to control how the light falls onto the light-sensitive surface. Lenses focus the light entering the camera, the size of the aperture can be widened or narrowed to let more or less light into the camera, and a shutter mechanism determines the amount of time the photo-sensitive surface is exposed to the light.</p>

    <h2>Camera Body</h2>
    <p>A camera body is the main part of the digital camera, which contains the controls, the LCD, the internal image sensor, and the associated circuitry. Basically, it includes all of the components needed to record the photograph. It is also the part of the camera that you'll hold when using the camera.</p>

    <h2>Camera Lense</h2>
    <p>The lens of a camera captures the light from the subject and brings it to a focus on the sensor. The design and manufacture of the lens is critical to the quality of the photograph being taken. The technological revolution in camera design in the 19th century revolutionized optical glass manufacture and lens design with great benefits for modern lens manufacture in a wide range of optical instruments from reading glasses to microscopes. Pioneers included Zeiss and Leitz.</p>
